                            <p>Data Protection Policy</p>

<p>1. Data protection principles</p>

<p>The Mark Hotel is committed to processing data in accordance with its responsibilities under the GDPR.</p>

<p>Article 5 of the GDPR requires that personal data shall be:</p>

<p>a. processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;</p>

<p>b. collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;</p>

<p>c. adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;</p>

<p>d. accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;</p>

<p>e. kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organizational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and</p>

<p>f. processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.</p>

<p>2. General provisions</p>

<p>a. This policy applies to all personal data processed by The Mark Hotel.</p>

<p>b. The Responsible Person shall take responsibility for The Mark Hotel’s ongoing compliance with this policy.</p>

<p>c. This policy shall be reviewed at least annually.</p>

<p>3.Lawful, fair and transparent processing </p>

<p>a. To ensure its processing of data is lawful, fair and transparent, The Mark Hotel shall maintain a Register of Systems.</p>

<p>b. The Register of Systems shall be reviewed at least annually.</p>

<p>c. Individuals have the right to access their personal data and any such requests made to The Mark Hotel shall be dealt with in a timely manner.</p>

<p>4.Lawful purposes</p>

<p>a. All data processed by The Mark Hotel must be done on one of the following lawful bases: consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interests:</p>

                                                      <p>i.Company must have a valid lawful basis in order to process personal data.</p>

                                                     <p>ii.There are several available lawful bases for processing. No single basis is ’better’ or more important than the others – which basis is most appropriate to use will depend on Company purpose and relationship with the individual.</p>

                                                    <p>iii.Most lawful bases require that processing is ‘necessary’. If Company can reasonably achieve the same purpose without the processing, Company won’t have a lawful basis.</p>

                                                   <p>iv.Company must determine Company lawful basis before Company begin processing, and Company will document it. Company will not swap to a different lawful basis at a later date without good reason.</p>

                                                     <p>v.Company privacy notice should include Company lawful basis for processing as well as the purposes of the processing.</p>

<p>b.The Mark Hotel shall note the appropriate lawful basis in the Register of Systems.</p>

<p>c.Where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for processing data, evidence of opt-in consent shall be kept with the personal data.</p>

<p>d. Where communications are sent to individuals based on their consent, the option for the individual to revoke their consent should be clearly available and systems should be in place to ensure such revocation is reflected accurately in The Mark Hotel ’s systems.</p>

<p>5.Data minimization</p>

<p>a. The Mark Hotel shall ensure that personal data is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.</p>

<p>b. The Mark Hotel shall identify any systems that store personal identifiable information and confirm compliance status of these systems.</p>

<p>6.Accuracy</p>

<p>a.The Mark Hotel shall take reasonable steps to ensure personal data is accurate.</p>

<p>b.Where necessary for the lawful basis on which data is processed, steps shall be put in place to ensure that personal data is kept up to date.</p>

<p>c.The Mark Hotel shall identify any systems that store personal identifiable information and confirm compliance status of these systems.</p>

<p>7.Archiving / removal</p>

<p>b. The archiving policy shall consider what data should/must be retained, for how long, and why.</p>
